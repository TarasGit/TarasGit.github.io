USB Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>
The starting point in this section is the introduction of the USB technology. Universal serial bus is one of the most used components to connect user's computer and peripherals.
Moors Low is still valid over the years and describes the phenomena that computation power of computes doubles every year. As a consequence there is a need to move an increasing amount of data between peripheral devices and host computer. Historical fact is that the USB was originally designed to overcome the shortcomings of various input and output interfaces found on computer architecture. Nowadays it is difficult to find an electronic device that does not have a USB port. Digital cameras, printers, keyboards and card readers are typical examples of devices that have USB interfaces.

<P>
Different devices use different data rates to exchange the information. So here are some of them:

<P>
Low speed was introduced in USB 1.0, the first generation of USB technology and supports data rates of 1.5 Mbit/s. It is used in devices like keyboards because there is no need to transport big data to or from device.

<P>
Full speed was introduced in USB 1.1 generation and brought data rates of 12 Mbit/s. The latency and the bandwidth is guaranteed for full speed devices. It means that the amount of data that can be transferred during one second and the amount of time it takes a packet to travel from source to destination is fixed. This property is used in microphones so that a good sound quality can be achieved. 

<P>
The hard drive devices easily become a bottleneck with full speed standard, whereas with high speed standard it becomes more comfortable and usable. High speed supports data rates of 480 Mbit/s and is available in the USB 2.0 generation.
Over the time the demand for higher performance in connection between the computer and the miscellaneous peripherals grows constantly. The super speed USB 3.0 standard was introduced in 2008 and adds an even higher transfer rate of 5 Gbit/s to match those needs. In 2013 the USB 3.1 technology was introduced, the super speed plus brings a data transfer rate of 10 Gbit/s.
