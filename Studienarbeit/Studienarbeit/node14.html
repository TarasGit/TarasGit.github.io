To be able to compile the right kernel configuration it was necessary to identify the special features of the hardware of the given smartphone. In order to proceed in the research it was important to analyze Samsung Nexus S hardware, its specification and configuration. This chapter will cover the common features of a System-on-Chip so that it will be possible afterwards to turn to the special Exynos platform designed by Samsung.

<P>
A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that includes various parts. Single monolithic systems include a processor, a bus and other elements. Integrated circuits are used in a wide range of electronic equipment like portable handheld devices. In general, System-on-Chip technology is the ability to place multiple subsystems on a single semiconductor chip. It typically uses a  powerful processor and is capable of running software such as the desktop versions of operating systems. 
The SoC design usually consumes less power, has lower costs and higher reliability then the multichip systems that they replace. The SoC typically consists of a 32-bit CPU cores with a separate core for USB. The SoC are optimized for efficient power consumption because in the most cases SoC has separate power supply.
The typical components are microcontrollers or microprozessors,  memory blocks which include ROM, RAM, EEPROM and flash memory. Another elements of SoC are peripherals like real timer controller and external interfaces including industry standard such as USB, FireWire or Ethernet.

<P>
The Figure 4: SoC Structure, shows that SoC is much more then only CPU cores. A SoC is to some extent a circuit board with a bus interconnecting a variety of different components. Because there is no standard, the manufacturer decides over the number and complexity of the components. Although most SoCs include a similar set of basic components, the SoCs are produced by different manufacturers. It is to mention that not all components within a SoC operate at the same clock speed, so CPU may work in gigahertz frequency and GPU with several hundred megahertz only. The GPU is responsible for accelerating the rendering of graphics to the device display. 

<P>
A big advantage of SoC is its tiny and universal structure. A  tiny structure of the system is due to placing the components on the same circuit. The universal feature is based on the possibility of SoC to be used on various devices with the minimalistic changes.
